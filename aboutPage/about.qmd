 I currently work in finance in NYC creating and applying advanced analytics to problems in fundamental and systematic investing. Previously, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis where I studied Computer Science and Finance. My main interests are modeling, machine learning, and capital markets. I love meeting and connecting with new people, so feel free to [email me](mailto:jcp@joshpearlson.com) or [LinkedIn message me](https://linkedin.com/in/josh-pearlson)!
